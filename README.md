I struggled to get ClickEvents to work despite working earlier in the process. Once I hit that wall, I went down the rabbit-hole trying to debug and found myself getting more & more lost and out of time. I want to take a step-back from this assignment and revisit in a few days to try and solve. Despite the struggle and feeling like I'm all thumbs, I feel like it's slightly starting to click. I'm just struggling being able to connect the dots.
